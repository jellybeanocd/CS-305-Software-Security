# CS-305-Software-Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  The client I worked with was Artemis Financial. The dealt with international customers, helping them create financial plans to better their life. Their concerns were with their security on their program as they were dealing with personal information that could be detrimental and life changing to their clients and to themselves if it was interecepted and a malicious user got ahold of it.

  What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
  I feel like I did a good job of finding a good solution and figuring out which cipher algorithms to use for this program. Also explaining what it was that I was doing and why I was doing it. It is very important to code securely because as a programmer it is our job to make sure the not only is the program built but they are safe and secure in using it. If you don't use security in you programs you could be putting everyone who uses it lives in jeapordy. Hackers could use your program to steal information or money and completely ruin peoples' lives. We need to ensure that doesn't happen. 

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  The vulnerabiltiy assessment was challenging at first. I had a hard time figuring out how to run vulnerabilities through the database to see more detailed information but once I figured it out it was very helpful because now I know how to do it with future programs.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  I used an algortihm cipher (SHA-256) to add a hex code that can make it nearly impoosible for hackers to figre out the code and intercept private information. I will continue to use Maven and OWASP for future vulnerabilites assessment.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  When I was finished dealing with the vulnerabilties I ran another check with Maven to see if any new ones popped up. I ran the code every time I changed anything to make sure it was running properly. 
  
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  I would honestly say that I would use everything I used in this course in future projects, unless they come up with something better.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  I would show them how I implemented the cipher and ran the Maven check to ensure the security of the project. I would show them my syntax and proper code usage to show them that I know what I am doing.
